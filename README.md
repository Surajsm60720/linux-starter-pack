## Linux Starter Pack

Linux, or sometimes as I like to call the OS where you are not just a user but a <b>developer</b> too, is having a huge list of variations 
in terms of even some basic features like the package managers to download the softwares between the plethora of distributions that its 
community has to offer.

### Major goal to build the project

- Help the newbies install and familiarise them with the environment of Linux terminal and most used commands.
- Cater to the power users who want to have the ability to have a single bash file to install some mostly used softwares.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Surajsm60720/linux-starter-pack.git
   ```
   Or simply download the file.

2. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   cd Downloads/linux-starter-pack
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 app.py
   ```

P.S. I just made a simple readme file that is 1000% going to change
